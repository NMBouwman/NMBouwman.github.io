Hello! My name is Niels Bouwman. I am a graduate student in physics from the Netherlands.

Everyday Lizardry is my personal blog where I share and document little projects on various topics. Most of these will touch upon fields such as mathematics, physics, cryptography and computer science, but can cover anything that piques my interest. I write in a way that attempts to engage readers in topics they might be unfamiliar with, by relying minimally on prior knowledge and by introducing new concepts on the go. After all, these blog posts are about personal curiosities. I believe the best way to share that excitement is to invite the reader to participate and explore the topics on their own.

I hope you will enjoy embarking on these personal journeys with me. <!--If you catch any errors or if you have any questions, please send an email to the address below.-->
