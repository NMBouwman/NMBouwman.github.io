Hello! My name is Niels Bouwman. I am a graduate student in Experimental Physics from the Netherlands.

Everyday Lizardry is my personal blog where I share and document little projects on various topics. Most of these will touch upon fields such as mathematics, physics, cryptography and computer science, but can cover anything that piques my interest. My writing attempts to stimulate engagement in unfamiliar topics, by relying minimally on prior knowledge and by introducing new concepts on the go. After all, these blog posts are about personal curiosities and projects that excite me. I believe the best way to share that excitement is to invite everyone to explore the topics along with me.

Why the name Everyday Lizardry? Mostly because I like lizards and enjoy the term <em>lizardry</em>: "The state or quality of being a lizard". I associate this with being laid-back and just doing things for the fun of it. The name captures the casual and accessible atmosphere that I aim for in this blog. It also makes for a fun theme that I'll definitely work on in the future. After lying in the sun for a little longer, of course.

I hope you enjoy reading about my personal journeys and curiosities. If you catch any errors, have any suggestions or if you have a question, feel free to send an email to the address below!
